# Keyboard-Tester
A program to test the key inputs on your keyboard. (Note that some keys may not work, such as Fn and PrtScn.) Highly inspired by www.keyboardtester.com. Criticism and suggestions welcome!
If you want to use the program with a live server (VSCode, etc.), download the "use with live server" folder.
If you want to use the program in your own computer locally, download the "use locally folder"
